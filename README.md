Live/Executable War with Jetty Embedded
=======================================

Code forked from Example taken from https://github.com/jetty/jetty-examples/tree/12.0.x/embedded/ee10-uber-war

  1. What was changed is moving from jakarta EE10 to javax EE8 to keep original servlet APIs support
  2. Adding servlet login and logout demos for GCP java oauth. These are demo snippets to adapt based on your application.

The project is deployable as it in AppEngine, via it's app.yaml file at the top directory:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ludoch/jetty12-ee8-embedded.git
$ cd jetty12-ee8-embedded
$ cloud auth login
$ gcloud app deploy --no-promote --version uber-war --project YOUR_PROJECT-id
```

See the app.yaml entrypoint pointing to the uber jar built in the assembly module:

```yaml
entrypoint: java -jar uber-war-assembly/target/uber-war-example.jar
```

## Setup the auth layer for AppEngine


- In the [Cloud Developers Console](https://cloud.google.com/console) >
API Manager > Credentials, create a OAuth Client ID for a Web Application.
You will need to provide an authorized redirect URI
origin: `https://<PROJECT_ID>.appspot.com/oauth2callback`.

- Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with these values in your
[app.yaml](/app.yaml)


This project should provide a baseline for those investigating the use of Embedded Jetty
from the point of view of a Self Executing WAR file.

The project has 4 main parts:

 1. `/uber-war-webapp/` - this is the WAR file, the webapp, as it exists in its native format, with normal maven
    `<packaging>war</packaging>` and a produced artifact that is just a WAR file that isn't (yet) self-executing.
 2. `/uver-war-server/` - this is the Embedded Jetty Server `jetty.livewar.ServerMain.main(String args[])` which you 
    customize to initialize your Jetty server and its WebApp.  This project also is the place where you customize
    for things like JDBC servers libraries, JNDI, logging, etc.   This project produces a uber-jar with all the
    dependencies needed to run the server.  Special care is taken with the `maven-shade-plugin` to merge
    `META-INF/services/` files.
 3. `/uber-war-bootstrap/` - this contains 2 small classes that sets up a `LiveWarClassLoader` from the content
    in the live WAR and then runs `jetty.livewar.ServerMain.main(String args[])` from this new ClassLoader.
    This project also contains the live `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` that the live WAR will need/use
 4. `/uber-war-assembly/` - this is the project that ties together the above 3 projects into a Live/Executable WAR file.
    The artifacts from from the above 3 projects are unpacked by the `maven-assembly-plugin` and put into
    place where they will be most functional (and safe).  For example, the server classes from
    `/theserver/` are placed in `/WEB-INF/jetty-server/` to make them inaccessible from Web Clients
    accessing the WAR file.

Note: there are 3 files present in your new assembled WAR file that you should be aware of, as these
files can be downloaded by a Web Client as static content if you use this setup.

 * `/jetty/bootstrap/JettyBootstrap.class`
 * `/jetty/bootstrap/LiveWarClassLoader.class`
 * `/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`

The example project is setup in such a way that information present in these bootstrap files should not
reveal private or sensitive information about your Server or its operations.  Merely that the Webapp
can be started as a Live/Executable WAR file.

Example:

```shell
$ mvn clean install
...(snip lots of build output)...
$ java -jar uber-war-assembly/target/uber-war-example.war
